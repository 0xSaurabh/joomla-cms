Install Node:  https://nodejs.org/en/
Run: `npm install` in this folder
Run: `grunt` will minify all javscripts in system/js and copy the 3rd part libs to media/vedor/*

To do only the second just run `grunt copy`

Make sure that you have updated the assets/package.json and ran 'npm install' in the sub directory assets,
in order to update the libraries!!!
@TODO: Add more functionality (maybe)
